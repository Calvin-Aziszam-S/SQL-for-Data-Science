## Description

Hello everyone! 

I want to share my mini portfolio when participating in the Data Science Intensive Bootcamp held by [MySkill](https://myskill.id/). This boot camp is divided into three major class sections: **SQL for Data Science**, **Data Visualization using Google Studio**, and **Python for Data Science**.

The first section of this boot camp is about learning and implementing SQL to retrieve and filter data from a database. The software used in this boot camp is PostgreSQL, but I use DBeaver with a MySQL server connected.

This mini SQL portfolio implements basic level SQL queries, intermediate level SQL queries, and advanced SQL queries.

In this section, MySkill team gave us two case studies that we had to work on using SQL queries. To see what I have done for the project, see attached SQL script.
